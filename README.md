# Empirical Network Scaling Analysis
## Overview
This is the repo for a large-scale analysis of empirical scaling behavior in networks. Primarily, this code includes methods for calculating mean geodesic distance of large networks, estimating mean geodesic distance through sampling methods, and uniformly sampling from the space of graphs with a fixed degree sequence. 
## Definitions
### Mean Geodesic Distance
We define
## Code Components
### `cpp_apsp`
`cpp_apsp` includes the code, headers, and tests for a parallelized C++ implementation of all pairs shortest path for a given network
